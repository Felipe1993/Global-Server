The Adventurers' Guild is a society of adventurers whose mission is to provide help and information to young adventurers. They are located on an island east of Calcanea and west of Thais' Lighthouse.

Their guild can be accessed by using an Adventurer's Stone in any city's temple. Players can get their first stone on the ship at the Island of Destiny or ask any Temple NPCs for an "Adventurers' Stone".
